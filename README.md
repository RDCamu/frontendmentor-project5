## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned the basics of HTML and CSS. Like adding color, border, and other decorative properties to html elements. I also used both flexbox and grid to layout elements in the page. Aside from that, I also got introduced to concepts such as responsive web design and semantic HTML.


### Continued development

After this project, I am eager to learn more about ways to make the site responsive to different screen sizes. As well as increase the accessibility of the site. Additionaly, I want to explore modern CSS to create better layouts with efficiency and cleaner code. I also want to know how to use a pre-processor.

### Useful resources

His examples and exercises are top-notch. This course is very beginner friendly so I highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn HTML/CSS.
